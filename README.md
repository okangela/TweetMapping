Semantic Mapping of Twitter Healthcare Related Posts to Formal Ontologies
=========================================================================

This repository is to satisfy the research task requirement for the Coursera Data Science, REal World project as defined by the Coursolve need; [Healthcare Twitter Analysis](https://www.coursolve.org/need/184)
This research task will be to explore the possibility and the usefulness of mapping tweet content 
(healthcare keywords) to formal ontologies at the [NCBO Bioportal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/).

I will develop a Python app to perform the search via REST API and generate a simple ontology to represent the links that can be analyzed and visualized via [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/).


The NCBO REST API examples are included here and modified so that you will place *your* API key in a file named ncbo_api_key.txt 
This file is in the ignore list and will not be upload to GitHub. However, there is an EXAMPLE_ncbo_api_key.txt that shows where to put your api key. You will need to register on the Bioportal to get your own key.  [Documentation for the Bioportal REST API](http://data.bioontology.org/documentation) is on their website. The [wiki](http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) contains a lot of useful information as well.
