Semantic Mapping of Twitter Healthcare Related Posts to Formal Ontologies
=========================================================================

This repository is to satisfy the research task requirement for the Coursera Data Science, REal World project as defined by the Coursolve need; Healthcare Twitter Analysis[1]
This research task will be to explore the possibility and the usefulness of mapping tweet content 
(healthcare keywords) to formal ontologies at the NCBO Bioportal [2].

I will develop a Python app to perform the search via REST API and generate a simple ontology to represent the links that can be analyzed and visualized via Protégé[3].
