Semantic Mapping of Twitter Healthcare Related Posts to Formal Ontologies
=========================================================================

This repository is to satisfy the research task requirement for the Coursera Data Science, REal World project as defined by the Coursolve need; Healthcare Twitter Analysis[1]
This research task will be to explore the possibility and the usefulness of mapping tweet content 
(healthcare keywords) to formal ontologies at the NCBO Bioportal [2].

I will develop a Python app to perform the search via REST API and generate a simple ontology to represent the links that can be analyzed and visualized via Protégé[3].


The NCBO REST API examples are included here and modified so that you will place *your* API key in a file named ncbo_api_key.txt 
This file is in the ignore list and will not be upload to GitHub. However, there is an EXAMPLE_ncbo_api_key.txt that shows a fake UUID api key. You will need to register on the Bioportal to get your own key.  Documentation for the Bioportal REST API is on their website[4]. The wiki contains a lot of useful information as well[5].
